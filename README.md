# Quora-Question-Answering
This project was inspired by my NLP coursera certificate on Natural Language Processing. In week course 3 of that certificate, I am working on Natural Language Processing tasks using sequential models. In this repository, I am uploading my Kaggle competition notebook for the expired quora competition. The data used in this project can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-question-pairs/data.
